Linear Regression Analysis - Cancer Mortality Data
Overview
This project implements linear regression analysis to predict cancer mortality rates using county-level demographic and health data. The assignment demonstrates both simple and multivariable linear regression using Python's scientific computing stack.
Dataset
The analysis uses cancer_data_cleaned.csv, which contains:

Target Variable: TARGET_deathRate - Cancer mortality rate per 100,000 people
Key Predictor: incidenceRate - Mean cancer diagnoses per 100,000
Additional Predictors: 15 demographic and socioeconomic variables including:

Median income
Population estimates
Poverty percentage
Median age
Healthcare coverage statistics
Demographic composition
